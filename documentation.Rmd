This is the firs part of the Developing Data Products project course of the Coursera Data Science Specialization.  This file is intended to be the documentation of the Shiny Application.  
  
In this application we use mtcars; one of the most viewed dataset in this specialization.

```{r}
mtcars
```

You can see more details on this site <https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html>  
Starting from two of the variables of the dataset:
```{r}
names(mtcars)
```
the goal of the apllication is to clusterize the cars.  
  
The application present itsels with a side panel where you can choose:  
- The variables to be represented in the graph  
- The number of clusters  

![Side Panel](/home/leone/rwd/9/panel.png)  
  
In particular we need the number of clusters, because this is an input value of the **k-means** method; the algorithm used to perform the clusterization.In the picture below we can see an example of the result of the application. The graph shows also the centers of the clusters.
